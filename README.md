# ML_breast_cancer_subtypes

Different subtypes of breast cancer have been shown to associate with different prognoses, responses to particular treatments, and the likelihood of metastasis. Gene expression profiling of breast cancers is one of the techniques that allowed for an informative classification of this disease. In this project, the goal is to take the RNA-seq data from the TCGA breast cancer samples and use different machine learning methods to classify the breast cancer samples into 5 intrinsic subtypes.
